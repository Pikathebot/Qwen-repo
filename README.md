# Jarvis — Private Local AI Assistant for Windows

A private, fast, and lightweight local AI assistant for Windows 11 powered by native `llama-server.exe` (llama.cpp) running **Qwen3.5-9B** and **Qwen3.5-4B** with full GPU offload (`-ngl 99 --no-mmap`), a modern Next.js/React desktop UI with workspace switching, 4-tab RightPanel, attachments, artifacts versioning, Model Context Protocol (MCP), dynamic skills loading, hardware resource governance, and voice interaction.

---

## Key Features

- **Native llama.cpp Execution**: Primary runtime uses `llama-server.exe` on port 8001 with 100% GPU VRAM offload and `-no-mmap` to conserve system RAM.
- **Canonical Next.js Desktop UI**: Polished React + Next.js + Tailwind CSS interface featuring Project Workspaces, 4-tab RightPanel (Artifacts, Files, Context, Activity), and Paperclip Attachment Composer.
- **SSE Streaming & FastAPI Backend**: Real-time token streaming via `/chat/stream` with tool execution updates and final metadata.
- **Unified SQLModel & Alembic Database**: Robust relational schema managing Projects, Sessions, Attachments, Artifacts, and Version History with automatic startup migrations.
- **Hardware Resource Governor (V2)**: Real-time PyNVML GPU/VRAM telemetry protecting your RTX 4060 GPU and CPU from overload.
- **Deterministic Safety Permissions**: $O(1)$ hardcoded security tiering (`LOW_RISK`, `CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`, `HIGH_RISK`) with SHA256 action approval tokens.
- **Model Routing (Normal vs Heavy)**: Local inference by default, dynamically routing complex reasoning to OpenRouter when enabled.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 stdio client for external tools and servers.
- **Dynamic Skills Loader**: Extensible Markdown-based domain skills (`skills/*.md`) with trigger keyword matching.
- **Hands-Free Voice Loop**: Wake-word detection ("Jarvis" / "Hey Jarvis") with local voice-activity detection, a 15-second follow-up window so follow-ups need no wake word, barge-in to interrupt a spoken reply, and neural TTS.
- **Persona Layer**: Selectable manner (`jarvis`, `assistant`, `operator`) controlling address, voice, tone and spoken reply length - without ever altering the tool protocol.
- **Ambient Awareness**: Proactive hardware observations (VRAM, thermals, RAM, disk, battery, model eviction) streamed over SSE, announced once rather than repeatedly, plus instant telemetry-assembled status briefings.
- **Always-On-Top HUD**: A transparent Tauri overlay summoned anywhere with `Ctrl+Shift+J` - voice orb, live telemetry rings, and its own voice session.

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch Jarvis
Run the batch launcher:
```powershell
.\Jarvis.bat
```
*(or run `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_jarvis.py`)*

To launch with legacy pywebview UI fallback:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_jarvis.py --legacy-ui
```

### 2. Run in Development Mode
**Backend:**
```powershell
cd backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Frontend:**
```powershell
cd desktop-app
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 3. Run Automated Tests
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```
`pytest.ini` sets the path, so this works from the repository root.
