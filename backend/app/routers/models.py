Model catalogue endpoints: what GGUFs exist, which one each slot uses, and how to change that.

Until now the two slots were pinned by ``LLAMA_MAIN_MODEL_PATH`` / ``LLAMA_FAST_MODEL_PATH`` and
could only be changed by editing ``.env`` and restarting. These endpoints make the choice a
runtime one, persisted through ``ModelCatalog``.
