"""
Awareness rules.

Each rule looks at one snapshot and decides whether the machine is in a state
worth mentioning. Rules are pure functions of the snapshot: no state, no
timers, no de-duplication — the monitor owns all of that, so a rule can be
read and tested on its own.

A rule returns None when the condition is clear. That "clear" answer is
meaningful: the monitor uses it to announce recovery for a condition it
previously warned about.
